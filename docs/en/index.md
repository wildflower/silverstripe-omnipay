## Use cases

Use this module to provide payment for things like:

 * Pay for invoice/bill/order
 * Event registrations
 * Make a donation
 * Renew a subscription
 * Top-up an account
 * Request a payment via email
 * Enter a user's credit card details via phone


## How it works

### Architecture

`Payment` is the main data model. It contains information such as the gateway (being) used to make the payment, the monetary amount (amount + currency), and the status of the payment.

`Payment` has many `Messages`. These represent all the types of logging / transaction messages associated with a single payment.

### Payment state machine

Here are the possible states a payment can have

 * Created - new payment model
 * Authorized - payment capture has been authorised by gateway
 * Captured - money has been sucessfully received
 * Completed - completely paid
 * Refund - funds have been returned to payer
 * Voided - payment has been cancelled


## Off-site vs On-site differences

On-site gateways require credit card details to be gathered on the application site, and off-site credit card details are gathered on another 3rd party website.

For off-site gateways, redirects **back** from the external gateway will first go to `PaymentGatewayController`, and then again redirect the user to your application. The user won't notice the redirect to `PaymentGatewayController`.

## Responsibilities

There are three different code bases to consider:

 * Application - your SilverStripe application that you want to include payment in.
 * Payment Module - this module. Handles SilverStripe integration.
 * Omnipay Framework - gateway interaction handling.

Your application is responsible for:
* Configuration of payment gateways, via YAML.
* Providing system data
    * amount
    * currency
    * return/cancel urls
* Providing customer data (depending on gateway requirements)
    * name
    * address for billing/shipping
    * credit card details
* Linking one, or many payments to the thing you want to pay for.

This payment module is responsible for:
* Providing a few models to store payment state, and history in
* Handling responses from external gateways
* Integrating with omnipay

The omnipay library is responsible for sending requests to the gateway servers, and parsing responses in to a consistent format.


## Data model

Developers have flexibility in choosing how `Payment` DataObjects are connected to their model, but it is recommended that you use a has_many relationship so that you can handle partial payments, and also it means that if one payment fails, then another payment can be made via different means.

Your model you connect payments to will generally be something like: `Bill`, `Invoice`, `Order`, `Donation`, `Registration`

An extension (`Payable`) has been written to provide the above functionality.


## Gateway Features

Different gateways have different features. This means you may get a different level of functionality, depending on the gateway you choose.

 * Delayed capturing. This means you can submit payment details for approval in one step (authorize) of your application, and actually capture the money in a secondary step (capture).
 * Enter credit card details on site. Some gateways allow entering credit card details to a form on your website, and other require users to visit another website to enter those details. This is also known as "on site" vs "off site" credit card processing. It is sometimes possible to emulate on site processing using an iframe containing the off-site payment page.

To see what features are supported, for the installed gateways, visit: `your-site-url/dev/payment`.


## Logging

This module logs as much information to the database as possible. This includes:

  * State changes
  * Problems / errors
  * Human notes
  * Gateway-specific data
  * Who performed actions / made changes


Payment messages can be Request, Response, or Error.

Errors could later be split into:
 * Communications
 * Validation
 * Failures

PurchaseRequest
 * PurchasedResponse
 * PurchaseRedirectResponse
 * PurchaseError

CompletePurchaseRequest
 * PurchasedResponse
 * CompletePurchaseError

AuthorizeRequest
 * AuthorizedResponse
 * AuthorizeRedirectResponse
 * AuthorizeError

CompleteAuthorizeRequest
 * AuthorizedResponse
 * CompleteAuthorizeError

CaptureRequest
 * CapturedResponse
 * CaptureError

RefundRequest
 * RefundedResponse
 * RefundError

VoidRequest
 * VoidedResponse
 * VoidError


## Payment scenarios

Here is how different gateway scenarios can play out:

### On-site 'purchase' gateway:

 * Purchase requested / or request failed
 * Purchase successful / or gateway response failure

### Off-site 'purchase' gateway:

 * Purchase requested / or request failed
 * Purchase request successful / or gateway responds with failure
 
  ...client now visits external gateway...

 * Complete purchase requested / or request failed (triggered by client return, or by a call from gateway server)
 * Complete purchase successful / or gateway responds with failure

### On-site 'authorize/capture' gateway:
 * Authorization requested / or request failed
 * Authorize successful / or gateway responds with failure

  ...later...

 * Capture requested / or request failed (triggered by system, admin, or user)
 * Capture successful / or gateway responds with failure

### Off-site 'authorize/capture' gateway:

 * Authorization requested / or request failed
 * Authorize successful / or gateway responds with failure

 ...client now visits external gateway...

 * Complete authorize requested / or request failed (triggered by client return, or by a call from gateway server)
 * Complete authorize successful / or gateway responds with failure

 ...later...

 * Capture requested / or request failed (triggered by system, admin, or user)
 * Capture successful / or gateway responds with failure

### 'manual' gateway:

 * Manual payment requested / or request failed

 ... payment is made via bank, cheque, cash etc ...

 * Manual payment completed by admin (or system?) / or fails for some reason?


## Security

Credit card details should never fall into the wrong hands! Be safe.

You should:

 * Become familiar with standard SilverStripe security measures, and implement where possible.
 * Use SSL security whenever there is a payment-related form.
 * Make the PaymentGatewayController use SSL.

### On-site vs Off-site gateways

Offsite gateways are a less risky way to get set up to take payments. This is because the responsibility of taking care of credit card details remains with them, as it is captured on their external web page.
