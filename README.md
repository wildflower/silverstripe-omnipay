The aim of this module is to make it easy for developers to add online payments to their SilverStripe application. It makes heavy use of the [Omnipay Library](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay).
There are many gateway options to choose from, and integrating with additional gateways has a structured approach that should be understandable.

A high quality, simple to use payment module will help to boost the SilverStripe ecosystem, as it allows applications to be profitable.

This module is a complete rewrite of the past Payment module. It is not backwards-compatible, but a migration task is available. In a nutshell, it wraps the PHP Omnipay payments library and provides some additional functionality. To understand more about omnipay, see: https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay

## Version

1.1

## Requirements

 * [silverstripe framework](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework) 3.1+
 * [omnipay](https://github.com/omnipay/omnipay) 1.1 + it's dependencies - which include guzzle and some symphony libraries.

## Features

 * Gateway configuration via yaml config.
 * Payment / transaction model handling.
 * Detailed + structured logging in the database.
 * Provide visitors with one, or many gateways to choose from.
 * Provides form fields, which can change per-gateway.
 * Caters for different types of gateways: on-site capturing, off-site capturing, and manual payment.
 * Wraps the [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) php library.
 * Multiple currencies.

## Compatible Payment Gateways

There are many gateways the come [out of the box](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay/tree/1.1#payment-gateways).
Note that currently this module uses version 1.1 of the ominpay library. Most gateways are packaged with the core library, some you can find seperate. Once we switch to version 2 of the omnipay library, all gateways will be seperate.

Searching packagist is useful: https://packagist.org/search/?q=omnipay

It is not too difficult to write your own gateway integration either, if needed.

## Installation

[Composer](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/installation/composer) is currently the only supported way to set up this module:
```
composer require burnbright/silverstripe-omnipay
```

## Configuration

You can configure gateway settings in your `mysite/_config/payment.yml` file. Here you can select a list of allowed gateways, and separately set the gateway-specific settings.

You can also choose to enable file logging by setting `file_logging` to 1.

```yaml
---
Name: payment
---
Payment:
    allowed_gateways:
        - 'PayPal_Express'
        - 'PaymentExpress_PxPay'
        - 'Manual'
    parameters:
        PayPal_Express:
            username: 'example.username.test'
            password: 'txjjllae802325'
            signature: 'wk32hkimhacsdfa'
        PaymentExpress_PxPost:
            username: 'EXAMPLEUSER'
            password: '235llgwxle4tol23l'
---
Except:
    environment: 'live'
---
Payment:
    file_logging: 1
    allowed_gateways:
        - 'Dummy'
    parameters:
        Paypal_Express:
            testMode: true
---
Only:
    environment: 'live'
---
Payment:
    parameters:
        PayPal_Express:
            username: 'liveexample.test'
            password: 'livepassawe23'
            signature: 'laivfe23235235'
        PaymentExpress_PxPost:
            username: 'LIVEUSER'
            password: 'n23nl2ltwlwjle'
---
```

The [SilverStripe documentation](http://doc.silverstripe.com/framework/en/topics/configuration#setting-configuration-via-yaml-files) explains more about yaml config files.

## Usage

### List available gateways

In your application, you may want to allow users to choose between a few different payment gateways. This can be useful for users if their first attempt is declined.

```php
$gateways = GatewayInfo::get_supported_gateways();
```

If no allowed gateways are configured, then the module will default to providing
the "Manual" gateway.

### Get payment form fields

The `GatewayFieldsFactory` helper class enables you to produce a list of appropriately configured form fields for the given gateway.

```php
$factory = new GatewayFieldsFactory($gateway);
$fields = $factory->getFields();
```

If the gateway is off-site, then no credit-card fields will be returned.

Fields have also been appropriately grouped, incase you only want to retrieve the credit card related fields, for example.

Required fields can be configured in the yaml config file, as this information is unfortunately not provided by omnipay:

```yaml
---
Name: payment
---
Payment:
    allowed_gateways:
        - 'PaymentExpress_PxPost'
    parameters:
        PaymentExpress_PxPost:
            username: 'EXAMPLEUSER'
            password: '235llgwxle4tol23l'
                required_fields:
                        - 'issueNumber'
                        - 'startMonth'
                        - 'startYear'
```

### Make your model Payable

You can optionally add the `Payable` extension to your model (e.g. Order, Subscription, Donation, Registration).
This will add a has_many `Payment` relationship to your model, and provide some additional functions
**NOTE:** You must create the associated has_one relationship on `Payment` yourself. This can be done with an extension or via the yaml config system.
For example, the following extension will be applied to `Payment`:
```php
class ShopPayment extends DataExtension {
    private static $has_one = array(
        'Order' => 'Order'
    );
}
```
With yaml:
```yaml
Payment:
    has_one:
        Order: Order
```

### Make a purchase

Using function chaining, we can create and configure a new payment object, and submit a request to the chosen gateway. The response object has a `redirect` function built in that will either redirect the user to the external gateway site, or to the given return url.

```php
    $payment = Payment::create()->init("PxPayGateway", 100, "NZD");
    $response = PurchaseService::create($payment)
        ->setReturnUrl($this->Link('complete')."/".$donation->ID)
        ->setCancelUrl($this->Link()."?message=payment cancelled")
        ->purchase($form->getData());
    $response->redirect();
```

Of course you don't need to chain all of these functions, as you may want to redirect somewhere else, or do some further setup.

After payment has been made, the user will be redirected to the given return url (or cancel url, if they cancelled).

### Passing correct data to the purchase function

The omnipay library has a defined set of parameters that need to be passed in. Here is a list of parameters that you should map your data to:
```
transactionId
firstName
lastName
email
company
billingAddress1
billingAddress2
billingCity
billingPostcode
billingState
billingCountry
billingPhone
shippingAddress1
shippingAddress2
shippingCity
shippingPostcode
shippingState
shippingCountry
shippingPhone
```

**Note:** `transactionId` can be a reference that identifies the thing you are paying for, such as an order reference id. It usually shows up on bank statements for reconciliation purposes, but ultimately depends how the gateway uses it.

### onCaptured hook

To call your custom code when returning from an off-site gateway, you'll need to
introduce an extension that utilises the onCaptured extension point.

For example:
```php
class ShopPayment extends DataExtension {

    private static $has_one = array(
        'Order' => 'Order'
    );

    public function onCaptured($response){
        $order = $this->owner->Order();
        $order->completePayment($this->owner);
    }

}
```

## Security

When customizing the payment flow (e.g. subclassing `PaymentForm` or `OrderProcessor`),
please take care to only pass whitelisted user input to `PurchaseService` and the underlying
omnipay gateways. The easiest way to ensure no arbitrary data can be injected
is by using `Form->getData()` rather than acessing `$_REQUEST` directly,
since this will only return you data for fields originally defined in the form.

## Debugging payments

A useful way to debug payment issues is to enable file logging:

```yaml
---
Name: payment
---
Payment:
    file_logging: true #or use 'verbose' for more detailed output
```

## Renaming gateways and translation

You can change the front-end visible name of a gateway using the translation system. The gateway name must match what you entered in the `allowed_gateways` yaml config.

For example, inside mysite/lang/en.yml:
```yaml
en:
  Payment:
    Paystation_Hosted: "Credit Card"
    PayPal_Express: "PayPal"
```

This approach can also be used to provide different translations.

## Caveats and Troubleshooting

Logs will be saved to `debug.log` in the root of your SilverStripe directory.

 * Payments have both an amount and a currency. That means you should check if all currencies match if you will be adding them up.

## Migrating from Payment module

Before you import your database and do a DB/build, add the following yaml config to your site:
```yaml
---
Name: payment
---
Payment:
    db:
        Status: "Enum('Created,Authorized,Captured,Refunded,Void,Incomplete,Success,Failure,Pending','Created')"
```
This will re-introduce old enumeration values to the DB.

Run the migration task: yoursite.com/dev/tasks/MigratePaymentTask
